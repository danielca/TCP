TCP
This repository is used for the ABOVE TCP communications portions. In the main branch will be both a python test client and the python server client.

There are two branches, one each for people developing. When a version is ready, it will be pushed to the main branch, and deployed on the server.

More documentation is soon to come.

This is currently in the early stages of development, if you have any questions please contact Casey Daniel at cdaniel@ucalgary.ca or Dr. Chris Cully at cmcully@ucalgary.ca
